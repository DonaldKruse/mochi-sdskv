# mochi service for keyvals

- implement any old keyval in the backend
- project key-val interface out to clients
- server does the store/retrieve

## Cloning

Until RobL figures out git submodules and branch tracking, we just copied Zi Qi Wang's BwTree implementation into our tree.

## Build requirements
- the ''mercury suite'': `mercury`, `margo`, `argobots`, `abt-snoozer`, and friends. 
- autotools

## Issues

## Notes
The [https://github.com/wangziqi2013/BwTree](BwTree) implementation in here
came from Zi Qi Wang's git repository.
