# mochi service for keyvals

- implement any old keyval in the backend
- project key-val interface out to clients
- server does the store/retrieve

## Cloning

We picked up Zi Qi Wang's BwTree implementation.  Be sure to clone with the ``--recursive`` option:

    git clone --recursive

## Build requirements
- the ''mercury suite'': `mercury`, `margo`, `argobots`, `abt-snoozer`, and friends. 
- autotools
- the [https://github.com/wangziqi2013/BwTree BwTree] implementation.  Should come along with everything else if you cloned with ``--recursive``
